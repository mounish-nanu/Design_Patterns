 *
 * The idea is that any payment service (old or new) can be connected to our app
 * as long as it provides an implementation of this interface.
 *
 * This keeps the client code flexible â€” tomorrow we can plug in a different
 * payment provider just by writing another adapter, without changing Main or
 * the rest of the code that uses PaymentProcessor.
